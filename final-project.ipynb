    "## Data set selection\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this section, you will need to provide the following information about the selected data set:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Source: [Kaggle – BMW Sales Dataset (2010–2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/) \n",
    "> - Fields: Year, Month, Model, Region, Sales Volume, Revenue  \n",
    "> - License: Open Data / Educational Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "I selected this dataset because I’m interested in how luxury vehicle sales evolve over time and across regions.  \n",
    "Analyzing BMW’s sales offers insights into consumer demand, growth trends in different markets, and the impact of external factors such as new model releases or economic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "1. How have BMW’s total global sales changed from 2010 to 2024?  \n",
    "2. Which regions have shown the strongest growth or decline?  \n",
    "3. Which BMW model lines (3-Series, X-Series, etc.) contribute most to sales? \n",
    "4. Are there noticeable seasonal sales patterns across years?  \n",
    "5. How does the shift toward electric models affect total performance? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "- Line chart – total global sales by year (trend analysis)\n",
    "- Bar chart – sales by region or model line (comparison)\n",
    "- Heatmap – correlations between revenue, sales, and time\n",
    "- Box plot – monthly sales distribution (seasonality)\n",
    "- Stacked area chart – EV vs non-EV share over time\n",
    "- Interactive Plotly chart – dynamic regional sales explorer\n",
    "These visualizations will help reveal patterns in sales performance, highlight regional differences, and provide a forecast of potential future trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "> I will analyze BMW’s global sales data from 2010–2024 using Pandas for data exploration and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> The plan is to:\n",
    "> 1. Clean and prepare the data by checking for missing values, duplicates, and converting the Year column to numeric.\n",
    "> 2. Perform descriptive statistics (mean, median, growth rates).\n",
    "> 3. Create 6–8 visualizations to examine sales trends, regional performance, model popularity, and correlations.\n",
    "> 4. Interpret findings to explain which regions and models drive performance and how the data reflects broader market trends.\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> These insights will help visualize BMW’s historical sales behavior and provide a baseline for future forecasting analysis.\n",
